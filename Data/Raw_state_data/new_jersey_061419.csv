Boost Mobile,5/20/2019,Data Breach,"Boost Mobile, a California-based mobile phone company, has identified unauthorized online account activity affecting an unknown number of customers. The letter posted to customers on Boost’s site provided vague details; however, it was noted that the Boost Mobile team implemented a permanent solution. Customers were sent new temporary PIN codes and asked to create a new PIN upon notification. To avoid credential stuffing, it was recommended that customers refrain from using simple codes such as 1234.","The NJCCIC advises Boost users to immediately change their PIN and review their online account to ensure the information is correct. If any information has been changed without user permission, immediately contact Boost Mobile Customer Care at 1-866-402-7366. Lastly, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available.

API tokens - an authentication token that replaces a username and password - have also been canceled, forcing users to reconnect manually. Docker has stated that they will “enhance the overall security processes and review policies.” The company does not yet offer multi-factor authentication despite users’ suggestions.",The NJCCIC recommends all Docker users change their password and follow recommendations found in the Docker advisory. We also advise those that have an API token to check API logs found on GitHub and BitBucket.

In addition, the data includes user email addresses, regardless if the user’s privacy settings were configured to hide that information from public view. LinkedIn refutes the claim that they were breached or that the leak originated from their database. Head of Trust & Safety at LinkedIn, Paul Rockwell, instead suggested that a third-party company exposed scraped data from LinkedIn public profiles.","The NJCCIC recommends LinkedIn users to review their public profile and update security and privacy settings as needed.

A cybercriminal was discovered selling access to a basic user account on a dark web criminal forum in Russian. The account, however, was able to modify ads, offers, and marketing analysis for several well-known business brands in the US. This access could leave the site exposed to sabotage and its users subject to possible malware. It appears that the threat actor targeted accounts of key employees, and infiltrated those accounts of past employees, vendors, and partners that were not disabled. Two frequently used methods of compromise are password spraying and “brute-force light” attacks. Sizmek CEO, Mark Grether, stated that appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards have been implemented, ensuring that the protocol issue has been corrected.",
Citrix,3/18/2019,Data Breach,"Citrix was contacted by the FBI recently about an internal network breach involving business documents potentially exposing customer data. The Iranian-linked group, IRIDIUM, has attacked more than 200 government agencies, oil and gas firms, and technology companies in the past. This targeted network intrusion, allegedly by the same group, was planned and organized with a likely used tactic of password spraying, which is a technique of exploiting weak passwords for a large number of accounts and ultimately bypassing additional layers of security. As this breach is still under investigation, the specific documents are currently unknown and there is no indication of compromise to Citrix products and services at the time of this writing.","The NJCCIC recommends using strong and unique passwords, using multi-factor authentication where available, and monitoring accounts and systems. We also encourage users to review Cybersecurity Best Practices here for more information on how to keep their accounts and data safe.

TurboTax,3/4/2019,Data Breach,"TurboTax customer tax return information has been exposed via a credential stuffing attack.

Any information disclosed on their tax return, such as Social Security number, date of birth, financial information, and any spouse and dependent information was available for the threat actor and can easily be used to commit identity theft. This incident is another reminder of the dangers of password reuse across multiple accounts. TurboTax temporarily disabled affected accounts; customers can call 1-800-944-8596 to verify their identity and reactivate their account. TurboTax is also offering a year of free identity protection, credit monitoring, and identity restoration services to impacted customers.",

Equifax,9/8/2017,Data Breach,"Yesterday, Equifax, one of the three largest consumer credit reporting and financial services providers in the United States, released a statement announcing a data breach that involves the personal information of an estimated 143 million US consumers. The company stated that it discovered the breach on July 29 and further forensic analysis revealed it resulted from the exploitation of a web application vulnerability that was used to gain unauthorized access to files containing sensitive consumer information. This access reportedly occurred from mid-May through July 2017. The information accessed includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver's license numbers. Credit card numbers for 209,000 US consumers and dispute documents with personally identifying information for 182,000 US consumers, were also accessed. Rick Smith, the Chairman and CEO of Equifax, released a YouTube video and a FAQ sheet regarding the breach and is asking consumers to contact their call center at 866-447-7559, which the company set up to assist consumers who have additional questions. Equifax also launched the website www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, which outlines the details of the data breach and provides additional resources for consumers. Equifax will send direct mail notices to consumers whose credit card numbers or dispute documents were impacted. Equifax is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for one year through TrustedID Premier to those affected by the breach.

It is unclear who is responsible for this breach and whether this was profit-motivated theft by a non-state, criminal actor or espionage collection activities carried out by, or on behalf of, a hostile nation-state. However, an anonymous actor has created a website on the dark web, badtouchyonqysm3[.]onion, claiming responsibility for the breach and is currently demanding a ransom payment of 600 Bitcoins (approximately $2.8 million) from Equifax. According to this website, if the payment is not received by September 15, the actor will publicly release the stolen data. Additionally, an anonymous twitter user, 1x0123 @real_1x0123, posted a screenshot and is purporting to sell access to various Equifax data repositories via a web shell for 1 Bitcoin (approximately $4,451). Neither of these claims have been confirmed and should not be considered as legitimate unless proven otherwise.","The NJCCIC recommends all of our members assume their sensitive personal information was compromised in this breach or one of the many incidents that have occurred in recent years and take immediate action to protect themselves against identity theft. If you were affected by a recent data breach, we strongly urge you to enroll in the free credit monitoring service provided by the victim organization. While credit monitoring is helpful in detecting suspicious or malicious activity, consumers should also consider identity theft insurance, which covers losses incurred as a result of successful fraud. The NJCCIC also recommends our members consider placing a security freeze on their credit, closely monitor bank and credit card accounts using SMS or email alerting options, and report any fraudulent activity to the Federal Trade Commission and your local law enforcement agency as soon as possible. While it may be an inconvenience, a credit freeze will prevent unauthorized loans and lines of credit from being opened in your name and it can be lifted whenever legitimate credit inquiries are necessary.

Additionally, the NJCCIC encourages all organizations that use web applications to access and manage sensitive data review the NJCCIC threat analysis titled, ""Web Apps: Vulnerable to Common Threats, Firewalls Recommended,"" consider deploying a web application firewall, and regularly perform security audits of all web applications."
